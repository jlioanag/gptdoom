[Verse 1]
He donned a mask like a 'tarded helmet, good go
Be on a mission, we going to change the price again
And get crackin money like we did Lex Luger
No rest, when they call me
He put the plant in his trunk, he's in trouble
All over town, try to make a show
You wanna see your state, send your soldiers, get crackin money
It's just a rumor, don't be joking

[Verse 2]
He donned a mask like a tux, good go
Along with the ducks, follow the donkeys

[Verse 3]
He dressed as a sheriff's dog for a bustin' man sweepin
A modern day marvel, the finest were waitin' for the first ever
Whoever got the cash, the shirt, the just-right amount
To go with the biggest crowd-funded hoes out there
together
(Fuck around) Yeah!

[Verse 4]
He wear a mask so he can't see the baby penis
Says dickasin on mescalones
Eternally on alert, this is some kind of project
Yo'll be digin some hip-hop, y'all
Everyone's crazy, so come and come with me
I'll have my personal style, yo
Yo, yo yo, yo ymm like a no-brainer
Forgot who you talking to, don't worry
It's me, me, me, me
Me too, me too, me too
Me too, me too, me too
Me too, me too, me too
Me too, me too, me too

====================
[Verse 1]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling a chick like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery what Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Verse 2]
Some stuff goes down easy, like punches that turn oxygenous
Food, water and medicine, tick tate
Mostly bad luck, touch the wire
Will it be fixed in the next 48 hours?
The easy way home, get a grip on my
Mm-hmm, that's a bit dry
The hard way, it's not like I see much of me
Oh, look at how much it has shrunken down
I think back to when I was little
The street price was right, now it's just
Beef and beans

[Outro]
Look, there's food for the weary
There's also soup and snack for the hungry
There's also a smokin' amount of drama brewing
It's a food war, where's the boba?
Rappers screaming in the room, fighting to keep things loud
With the food, there's nothing funny about today's food
Fresh and favorite, like how you wash your feet?
This is food wars like chicken nuggets versus bagels
Bumbo bagels, fresh and easy to whip, ready to go
It's like the same damn thing the next time you whip up a foodworthy package
[Produced by MF DOOM]

This package set will bring comfort to a
Crook with learning disabilities
May be wrong, but he's still a smart
Here in the house, make sure he looks like a hero

[Verse 1]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ...

[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve

I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

Trying to figure out what's going on
(Super!) How come I never hear from him
(Heh, that's a good point)
I've been trying to get some business from him
(Well, what's his plan?)
He just happened to come up empty handed
Got'ed me a check for ten grand
Well nothing comes quick like a hit
"BITE"

I just made a new camera
I got a ton of new equipment
It's like a shell on steak, right up front
It's like a leprechaun on the beat
New style to it all and it's soooo funny
You gonna like it, the camera's like a charm

[Verse 2]
It's like a knock knock on the door
I just came in, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing, what's the matter?
You never know what's lurking in the shadows
Then you might wanna enter
It's like a knock on the door
Sherlock, up next, be serious
.. You never know what's lurking in the shadows

Earthlings seeking a new Egypt
Oh, ne'en sight

Feeling the wrath of the most powerful, a nation is born
It's a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster, a disaster

Mmmm, these tears make me wanna cry

(villian) You kidding me?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4: Megalon]
When the last one bled like dry erase
Bust in, wipe on the other hand's dry set
The mask to my face, wish I say more
To people thinking they can get away with it, light them fangirls
Oh yeah, once the sweaters hit the bays
Everyone bled like bled like bleded
In the place to be like there's nothing they can do
Other than

Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo

I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like [?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were in Cuba, I'd take all ya pesos
So giddyup, this is earthquake on ya stereo
Fuck with me I leave ya soggy like some cereal

Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up you get blown up like flagball

Pull a fast one, then Derek Jeter
Drop 54, then low blow the other one
Either one of 'emies bigger or lower, split third
You be the judge. I'm the prosecutor.

Megalon and wife Jane from Hell
And she gon' be gon' do some crazy shit
Yeah, and she gon' have some of the most fucked up mothers in the world
And she gon' try to be funny, but she can't be fuckin funny
So I'll be straight, everybody. You're like the oven balling, idiot
Y'all you?
Yeah, and I'll give her some leeway
If she wants to go back in time and do the thing, like "eh, so I'm the one to do that"

Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfucking mills
So we loose, we loose, we loose
Death valley is like a prison, to the tracks you get the Expressionist
Bar: Raised by a free spirit, keep his hammer in fenced in
Villain, give him something to remember like the Batmobile
The key, the car, down to the final test
Nobody knows the secret that riddick—red—vivid
What's the name? It might be Anglicized as Raised by the Gun

It's been a minute, think they've lost it

This is real life, and he won't stop the battle
In the air, him and Felyne
continue to battle, even as they defeat
Like a player on a reckless skit, Felyne
Can't stand Donald Trump
[Verse]
Caesar gets lucky and gets to shine
In his right hand, a justice who never before had
On the losing end and the last to know
The realest, most powerful man on the whole block
Known for writing lightning-rod heads
One-two, tie the knot at the perfect time
Leavin' players, we're all the same

[Outro]
Weezer
====================
[Verse 1]
He stay away from girls who's kids
The effeminate kind
Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch
In school, he kept a doo-rag in his bag lunch
Just to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit
He writ this skit in Sanskrit
If the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low
Your man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though
It's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow
Tucked-in Le Tigre—just let the name-buckle show

[Verse 2]
Good googly moogly—see that loogie?
Yeah—but keep it on the D.L. Hughley
You don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie
Just to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*—Mitsurugi
Gooey gum drops—who he got his style from?
—his pops—you gotta give the bum some props
Ask ya sister—her beat box is more-thicker
DOOM that nigga detox with more liquor

[Verse 3]
Villain for hire—admire the sound
Make sure the price is right before he come on down!
Rappers be on some "You, you, you!"
Forgot who they talking too, too much pork stew
They need to not come out with nothing new
Blew the whole shit up on some "What this button do?"
Doom cheat the game like walk-thru
Run 'em, son 'em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo
The way alotta clowns get down is unnatural
This flow flip like oranges, apples
Rhymes like limes to a Lemonade Snapple
Leave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple
First thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone
Then they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on
In came the Villain with their own gear like, "Hi, there
Y'all play the rear, this whole year—my year."
Metal face beard like Brillo pad
Y'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad
Seed call him, "Ol' dad," the one the ol' ho had
Knew he was a winner since a swimmer in the
====================
[Verse 1]
I was slovenly rich and drudge biatchy
Had no idea what a peso is
Was a peso by design, now he tries to explain it to me
By asking about pesos and I tell him it's the pantsuits
Sons of a chick showed up, pissed me, I said "Get off"
She came to pick me up, I was too lazy to move
Sparked up and get this girl, I'ma hook her up with a hotel
And be like B.B. King: Sketchy, poor man

I'm from Brooklyn

[Verse]
There's only one beer left
Rumor has it - a Velveeta
Velveeta is what got me started
Pork belly, middle-aged woman like knowledge
Told me, "Get a hand like me, not from now on"
I'm like, "What you doing? You don't have a hand like me"

[Verse 2]
What, three-quarters full? That's quite a number
Major-league, all that? Oh no
Majority, vote for worst episode
Majority, give the order of the month
To the villain in the crown bracket
Section 8! Choo-hee!
Section 8! Section 8!

What's the hero up to this point?
Shao Kahn—the greatest—the world-renowned master of the highest order?
You don't even know him, but he keeps a watchful eye on us
We were blessed with the greatest minds ever born
He came to this nation to train
And lead, and see that we remain faithful
We are still faithful, and he is our guard

Ain't nothin new to a scrappy crawfish
Tried to hide, took

What a remarkable remarkable revelation his face was white
Who, then, is he?
A Negro, a Negro, a Negro

[Chorus]
He that laugh, that laugh, that laugh, that laugh, that laugh,

Oh on and on and on and on and on
Bothered by all that, now that

[Verse 2]
Ah! from the corners of your eyes
You're not sure what to make of this
Ha-ha! there's snakes in the snake web
You must be nuts
You thought you saw the Spider-Woman with her banana peel
She thought she saw you, you know who you are
A superhero, born and living in Brooklyn
Illicit sales of topical creams in the six pack
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man
[Intro]
Everything as it seems
What's the man's plan?

He that laugh, that laugh, that laugh, that laugh, that laugh,
Oh on and on and on and on and on
Bothered by all that, now that

Ah! from the corners of your eyes
You're not sure what to make of this
Ha ha! there's snakes in the snake web
You must be nuts
You thought you saw the Spider-Woman with her banana peel

A superhero, born and living in Brooklyn
Illicit sales of topical creams in the six pack
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand

[Verse 1]
I stayed away from niggas that got bloodsport
They jealous niggas got left behind
Even motherfuckers got morals
Just got bickered over text
FUCK LESTER

[Verse 2]
Villain ran a scam on his imaginary graham
Villain, his mad scheme is just a simple scam
But he's mad so many of his men lie
About to go off the force
About to get his girlfriend but he can't get her
She's too soft, unemotional, he must've vomited
Out of work for the week, have to go back to school
Wanting to sell crack, man want real crack
But the dealer ain't really all bad
He Play Business, Runs A-C-At, Knew He' Mad Before You Had Askin'
Coughin' to a coffin pressured, he even threw a spanner in his grave
Prepare to wait, the hood ain't far from Hereford
If they ever come get me
I'm led to the villain's den, and there I will find and sell
Cannibal Corpse
[Intro]
In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse]
I was in New York on a record deal gone wrong
Shit, an earthquake has just hit New York
It's not a good, it's not a day off for Megalon or for Bertha
Earthquake is here
Blare it in your krills, let it roll in your chest
Just like that

[Outro]
Look, there's Doom now and Doom's got his own label
Iowawbe, could you come on down and do the thing
Look, Doom, you know what's hot? Draw big, like [Instrumental]

It's a shame we don't have more of these
In the year of 1994, I.D.E. is back
Iowup! Time to get my gunigan on
Dead to this whole situation from which we're going
(Dead to this whole situation) from which we're going
(Dead to this whole situation)
from which we're going
(Dead to this whole situation)

BK Farrah cause she loves to do the thing

====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super) ho"
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, either
Cause I'm lazy, blind and I'm a bitch

The only one complaint is that she asking me if I'm all right
I say fuck you i'm all right
And if she wanna stay, go back to the States

[Verse 2]
I played the part of the lazy, blind, deaf and dumb
Who got time for one song
Slave history, baby
The baddest ass bitch in the world

[Verse 3]
You know when you wanna come with us?
It's like a big church, kinda small, kinda hilly
With some rock and you know, you know, you know, it's just gonna be a surprise
For real, you know?

[Verse 4]
It's been a while since I last held a fistfight
Before this year's, you know?
It's like a year from now
I guess
No I'm-I'm not into champagne
Faces folded, out the window into burnt-earth-look
This will be a known road, way to way way way
To way way way way way way my man

[Verse 5]
Heh, that's a picture like lion's jawing
Crying wolf, grimy like a day lion
Holding a grimy grimy grimy
Scarecrow, cause I'm the type to turn heads
Heating the building, foul play
Caused the madness, actual foul play
Showed no sign of abatement, existence of some kind
Found 'em in a secluded spot
Near the river, a bomb shelter
Coolin' with the stray cat, some say it's a... Shaolin
Symbolism tattooed, the same on all of them
Except Shaolin, the monkey man, villain
And y'all be best friends
Well it's just a simple webcombinin' joke
So... Put the mask on...
[Outro]
You know when you wanna come with us?
It's like a year from now
I guess
No I'm not into champagne
Faces fold, out the window into burnt-earth-look
This will be a known road, way to way way way way my man

[Verse 1]
I was thirteen years old when my biological father gave up and I went to go and inherit the dead tree
Skull-oil, high-fives, advice, lessons left over
What's the deal?
[Verse 2]
...you told 'em, y'all didn't tell, y'all didn't give a fuck
[Verse 3]
Ain't y'all up in the air when it comes to flows and twists
Some cats are made to careen off a catheter
Seeds believe they dead, measured, no strings attached
I told 'em, uh, uh, uh, it's all fair - just be damn
[Verse 4]
Be up front when telling y'all not to run the risk of getting slapped
'Nuff said

[Verse 5]
Shout out the late co-star show host
SpaceGhost
Who got ho's coast to coast
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
This show's a barricade, don't get out
In, in, in
Stress, worry, frustration, empty promises
Dead zones, there's lines
For the mic, the open mic
The place is full of dames
From club to club, bitch 'n blast, bugged out, pissed off
This is real life
From there it's like roller coaster to gut punchin'
I crack a smile, now I'm chokin'
At times, I'm like Bruce Leroy
Scrubbing the mug, sometimes he just let me get the herb oil
Or else he find out and pass the pot of hot grease
Hawk men stalkin' like Spades of Italy
The more metaphors you cubbit
Throw away, the more blows the man got
That's in the weed, the more they dusted off
The same plants, the same flakes, the same powder
In the same spot, under the wrong skin, in the wrong place
In the wrong neighborhood, you might as well ask
Which one the?
Villain, he's the villain in the whole movie
Butter brown hair, glasses, and glasses of orange juice
Every day, working as a stripper for

[Verse 1]
I was in touch with my godfather when he died
When he went, he left behind footprints that make an E
That's right, when he goes, he'll disappear
And what's the chance of that? To find out, and trace the footsteps
By remote, and send a telegram
To all who might listen

Who do you think do the voice?

One-two, stack your louis
Eyefront, stoppin' the show like Pat Boone
Refresher whistles as he scoops off a droop
Spitting on people who sound like they used to
Tense, whisper, or just giggle
Sad, as some is calling him
The other one-two, dykin'
Who do you think will do the voice?
The man who almost tripped on a cat tail
Sing when he overthought things
Tense, grunting, or just plain off the top
Don't know what he saying, ask now

[Scott Free]

[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to

That'll have you followed
[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold
In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say
Wait a motherfucking minute! True facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted
The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

Doom has taken over every continent

[Verse 1 : Ghostface Killah]
Both hands clusty, chilling with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now

[Bridge]
When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle
Shake that body, party

I had this style ever since I was a child

Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?

In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse 1:Earthquake]
I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like [?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were in Cuba, I'd take all ya pesos
So giddyup, this is earthquake on ya stereo
Fuck with me I leave ya soggy like some cereal
I'm gone, checkmate

[Hook]
Make a move like chess then checkmate
I

Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them

At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though"
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

[Interlude]
Three thousand years ago, Moses said to him, "Suppose I never meet a God that I've never met."
Far as I'm concerned, that's a sealed package
That's still open and has never been opened
Sealed, that's what they say, right?
So I'll open it and have a look at it

[Verse 2]
I'd like to say hi

"Hi!"
"You too!"
"You seem to be enjoying yourself."
"That's a known fact that I haven't heard from you in a while."
"Okay, then tell 'em about the time they broke the door
And it's a bummer.' "
What a story that was! It's a BOMB! It's a BOMB!
A TNT ALERT!

[Verse 3]
One for the money, two for the better green
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the story: a young black man in the process of finding fame
He encounters an unusual proposition
And meets the stuffy demeanor of the mouth
When he leaves it to the wolves, he finds themselves (in)operations
included
Sir, the man who sold crack
Inventor of the impossible, stashed it in a man's pocket
What a remarkable story, perhaps it's time for the end

[Outro]
As I Knew They Afraid Son, Oh I knew they found him
They did, especially when they showed him the razor
He Won't Be Confident In The Lastword, But It's True
Writ
====================
[Verse 1]
He inhale the air, "Repo florist"
Gentleman fold folded
The rumor is, he don't smoke, he think I do
He hook a hoe, two lugs full, two more lugs in
A trap, in a cave, man can't move
He read the signs, "Don't walk on eggshells, see I'm stuck in this shit"

[Verse 2]
He (The Killer say, "He") sound like he's from another planet
Voice-splitting moment, as if to say, "Hey, man, what's up?"
Man can't move, talk, clothe, clothe
This for real, in the shit hall, in the gym
He (The Killer), this shit be real, in the shit hall

[Verse 3]
He (The Killer), this shit be real, in the shit hall
He (The Killer), beat it, it be some kind of chain gang
Front, you still got the same dumb shits about to scrub
The same shit, y'all, wet your tracks, get some rest

[Verse 4]
He (The Killer), shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
Metal Face Finale, what the fuck?
Holy moly, grab the mic, lead the way
Rappers rapping, screaming, getting pussy wild
Tiring of the grind, heartthrobs rapping, screaming
Loud enough to step to a full blown chord, but not too loud
To let the world see you made the cut
Not my guy, the way your hair grow was ugly
The way you dress makes me feel thin
The only reason I come out in a suit is to look cool
I'm a bat for ya, I'm a bat for ya

[Outro]
You got any money? (What?)
What? (What?)

[Chorus: George Michael]
Oh shut the fuck up faggot,
Let me check your e-mail
Invest the money you got, show me your paper
Or else I'll bullseye and shoot you

[Verse 1: Megalon]
Stoop down Dahomey street, you bugged me, didn't
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you didn't do shit!"
You know the Super Villain, (He did), he literally stepped through my door
And peep me, like that's the way he walk through walls
I'ma kick your ass just to get a nickels
But y'all not the first to feel the urge
To smoker some XXX, I leave some to dry
I leave a nickels, for people who ain't used to see me
I ain't havin' the charisma, the will to put a bod down
But I can tell you somethin', don't you?
You not stupid, I saw what you did to my face
[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Verse 1 : Big Punisher]
Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Segall
Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (that's
====================
[Verse 1]
I was raised by a dead black eye
 from whitewashing my face in the dirt sweep
When I was three I became aware of a mask made of glass
That was hidden in an ambush. When I look at you, I hope you're dead
From which came your first guns
And what became of them?
[Intro]
She look like half-naked
I thought I'd make 'em look like half-naked
I used to believe in black m'alls
But they make you feel like you're in a fairy tale
I'm a woman, and I live a lie
Every day I go to the park to play ball
But she make me feel thin
Every day I go to the drug deal
But she make me feel full
Every day I go to the rec center to buy a bag
But she make me hallucinate
(I'm dreaming)

[Verse 2]
She look like half-naked
I used to believe in black m'alls
But they make you feel like you're in a fairy tale
I'm a woman, and I live a lie
Every day I go to the park to play ball
But she make me hallucinate
(I'm dreaming)

[Verse 3]
Pretty as a ruby, but with a slit
And a curse to keep her rich
Keep her wit back Kindles that's 'til I get the cash
Thesauri glass show brotherly
Swing sickle, get outta here
Let out the renegade's, get the damn thing

[Verse 4]
Bic, lie, keeptin't have
Got no battle under the stars, go home)
We were tricked, by the devil, we dupes
We were led to believe that
We were dumb, by the Devil, by MF
We were tricked, by the freaky-ass, we dupes
By the blues, by the blind, blind faith
We were tricked, by the god, by the National
We were tricked, by the demon, by the illiterate, blind faith
We were tricked, by the demon, by the freaky-ass, we blind faith
We were tricked, by the demon, by the freaky-ass, by the blind faith

[Verse 5]
I remember when, last week, we were playing
====================
[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to
====================
[Verse 1]
I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Same guy, same thing
Slightly larger, slightly thinner, depending on how you look at it
Hell yeah, Hell yeah

[Verse 2]
You don't even know that shit, man, shit
You know, it's like, like, a no-brainer
Keep it on, man, keep it on
[Verse 3]
He don't even know that shit, shit
He should know, like, fuck that
[Verse 4]
Holy sakes, these dudes are going to blow up Hollywood
Like the lights in the room lit, like a horror story
Like the light in the room dim, like a donnel
He should know, like, fuck that
[Verse 5]
Holy up ahead, these are the first hoes we catch
Like the watercolor watercolor
The first time I hit it, I almost drowned
Like the way his hair was curl]
He almost drowned, he probably should've drowned
Like the way his hair was curl]

[Verse 6]
It's like a mosquito, it's like a mongoose
Wait, a mosquito that's like, it's like a mongoose spray it
All of a sudden it's the next biggest thing
Meant to be picked up, but who don't know
So we figure it's best not to worry about that

[Verse 7]
 Pretty like a girl, like Sayid in a kilt
She always kept me fit, never weary from the efforts

[Verse 8]
She wearing a tank top, she know what I'm saying
It's gon' get me money, but gotta keep my suit on, so I'm chill
So social, chill, and speak one language
Only met chick through MPV
I'm from Brooklyn, and I heard music
From the type of mom who's really into shows and stuff
Who she helped make her S-Catshit-style
See all the funny names, and sheh go here
Find out where her hoes go sign autographs
For real, girl
[Instrumental]
[Verse]
Joking nicknames, there's only one artist allowed at the studio
The one with the temper of a teapot
The one that can't stand anybody, can
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

[Verse 2]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for once (?) and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender
====================
[Verse 1]
I always knew, always had been, there was something to that
Astray, that I should...
Excuse me, I often wondered what was lurking in my heart
As I meditated, I came to realize
It was madness
Forsake God, and believe him, he is the supreme being
All of a sudden, I was filled with dread
My whole being was under siege
My mind was filled with suggestions and comfort
It was a state of disarray, a state of confusion
I was being tortured
I had been seeking, seeking, seeking
For something that would comfort me
For a long time, I had feared, feared that I would find someone to listen
And have a happy and successful life

[Interlude: MF Doom]
(I knew that was the last time I saw you)
Did you hear that? It's not funny at all
It's true, when we as a band try to stand up and do something
We were once more struck down by lightning
And have tried to do a full blown cover of Black Beat
 again, but with more destruction
This time it's just one more day at a time

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
When we as a band try to stand up and do something
We were once again struck down by lightning
And have tried to do a full blown cover of Black Beat
 again, but with more destruction
This time it's just one more day at a time

[Outro: DOOM]
Doomsday!
[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]
[Instrumental]
[Verse]
Lightning fast and completely consumed by it's flames, darkness continue to pour
Light up the skies as darkness covers everything
Everything, for one last chance try, try and try and try to try
To myself and for the last time myself, for once I'm trying to go
I'm calling these attempts at attempts at attempts at attempts at
At times, trying to be genuine and other times, trying to be cynical
A lot of times, it's just a form of intimidation
Sometimes, it's just a nasty cold hearted chap trying to be my friend
Sometimes, it's just a bit of spirit with me and you know
It's very simple, it's what it's built
====================
[Verse 1]
I keep it real, sort of get it, sort of get lost in it
The world keeps on spinnin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose
Back to you MF Doom, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
{?} in the story, whatever the case
I call the call - Doom, CLKO
Got'ed (Deleted) that Sound Factory 13
0 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +[Intro]
It's been a while since I've held a grudge
More than a few, if not more
Emcees below guilty pleas
Born under fire, the last thing they saw was a soft smack
On the door step
"What the?" Came over from the bathroom
"Nothing, nothing" Came from the depths of hell
You know the one with the gas drawls
Who breathe life and take a sick break
You gotta let the bitch know how you feel
You must feel him, he's my brother
"Fuck the way you legs are" - Daddy Yankee
"What you see is who you make the deal with" - Spades - Sesshomaru
"DOOM is master of the world" - Big Daddy Kane
"And the way he sees the world is horrible" - The God Eaters

[Verse 2]
From the get-go you can see how it really is — everybody's work
Spots are large and the streets are crowded
To the sidewalk people turning
Refresher mint, yelling "Mmm! Mrs. Worthington!"
Cryin', "Whiskey daddy, is you mad?"
Apple Valley water, 4th rail, gone
To the States, where the Jews raise their sons
He goes:)
I began my career as a policeman
While I was running errands
Running with the U.K. Army
I was raised by the stray dogs
A little too soon, I tell you
PNS star system, Eiffel
Mound high, chain-smoking ham
Guess what? Towering
Above the City Hall

====================
[Verse 1]
He donned a camouflage mask for cover, yelling, "Change the heat!"
When he got blues he wear a bandana
On his face is a B, B, A, A stashed it somewhere
Awkward moment, immediately jump to your conclusion
Either explain yourself or hide your face from the camera

[Verse 2]
He wear a mask just to conceal his face from the camera
[Verse 3]
He just wants to be known to say hello
Whenever he sees you, it's a glance
That's a word, him turning it to human bark
Tried to hit it, you might catch a toothpaste charge
Or a slip on a label
That's nontransparent, you know, Kinda Wondering
Whether it's a brand new bike, a used one
What they not using, they used to be good
Our species are just beginning, we're living in an experiment
That's called artificial intelligence

[Verse 4]
He came to save the day, to do something
Something that he did, he does it all the time
You see him in the mirror, hands are boiling
Telling on a rack, naked and drugged
He took those hands and put them around the throat
Fuck that, I'll give him some props
He did it to the wack, he did it to the kids
Mmm, that's the dandy one
The one with the yeast, drink him like a beer
[Outro]
We have got to try and find DOOM
Operation Doomsday complete
All your intercoms dead, you got some sparkle
You got to try and find DOOM before he get rid of all of these bees

[Chorus]
He took those mics, and took 'em with a torn shirt
I'll take 'em if I can
If I can, I'm going to the arena

[Verse 1]
He took those mics, and took 'em with a torn shirt
I'll take that style if I can
If I can, I'm going to the ring

[Verse 2]
He took those mics, and took 'em with a torn shirt
I'll take that style if I can
If I can, I'm going to the ring

[Chorus]
He took those mics, and took

They might know a retard like son
Stop calling me "son" or something
Stop bothering me at all
I'm just trying to help

[Verse 2]
He sold CDs like dimes
The ho's like Dimes, the pop players like him
The super-duper-is like a brother
Who told the super-villain, "Drop the hat"
He drops by just to see if he can lend a hand
Never seen him before, how he get places like this
I wonder if he's human
What he wants is food, but damn if he can't get it
[Chorus]
It's on," don't let it get too big
For now, let the flame go
The world keeps on burning
It's a little brighter than we imagine
The sky is screaming

[Verse 3]
He sold CDs like dimes
The ho's like Dimes, the pop players like him
The super-duper-is like a brother
Who told the super-villain, "Drop the hat"
He drops by just to see if he can lend a hand
Never seen him before, how he get places like this
I wonder if he's human
What he wants is food, but damn if he can't get it

[Chorus]
It's on," don't let it get too big
For now, let the flame go
The world keeps on burning
It's a little brighter than we imagine
The sky is screaming

[Verse 4]
He sold CDs like dimes
The ho's like Dimes, the pop players like him
The super-duper-is like a brother
Who told the super-villain, "Drop the hat"
He drops by just to see if he can lend a hand
Never seen him before, how he get places like this
I wonder if he's human
What he wants is food, but damn if he can't get it
[Verse 5]
He sold CDs like dimes
The ho's like Dimes, the pop players like him

====================
[Verse 1]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
To, To, to, to, to
Muttballs, extra mottballs, more trouble
Punk, diet soda, skit changed, call it how I see
In, in the dirtiest twist, the world keeps on shifting
Steeped in the boundless, you won't stop the game
But only if you pay attention

[Verse 2]

Hey, y'all know the pitch
The one with the hundred dollar bill?
Twelve hoes and a hundred mad men
Squirts in the back, killing muggles
Causing trouble like the street in a crowd
Let alone the inches
Pay special attention and keep your cool man
[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Verse 1 : Big Punisher]
Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime, deal thimble-ugh
And the only difference is we can't all be Pussies
(True, but that's another issue)

[Verse 2 : Cuban Link]
Punisher, the cool shit, knock 'em over, kid
Doubt your shot, pass the Buddha, listen to Sam Cooke
If you see me over there (breath) of trouble, I'll knock the hell out of you
Poisoned a few, sick babies, CNN is down
Bitch, I'm like a rabbi, tell 'em, Don't listen
To the great rabbi, Moses, the one with the golden rings
That bugged me the most was the way she looked
I don't like to speak my mind, fuck around
But uh... lend a hand if I see you
Bitch, don't make 'em have to get medical
I'll be fucking around, I'm sorry if I'm strange
But don't make 'em have to get medical
Cause I ain'tho'ople woulda'lauer cut the load
Cut the load in half, less wait for the
Cats, cats don't shy from tricky business
And I'lla'M-lashed, double-platinum like Steven Segall
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop laces
From drive
====================
[Verse 1]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Supervillain who broke the curse
Leave no stone unharmed, wit' as few bullets as a speeding knife
Leave no stone unturned, in the game of cat herring
Rappers rapping in cool white Citroen
The unicycles cast iron, come on boys
It's just a few of the styles he's been throwing at us
The ones that's close to the vest, like how he fought Jet Jaguar
For the right, who should, what he learned
How to be a better Negro, what he's learned
How to handle a better life
He's a villain, remember what he told you
You 'bout to stop thinking that way
"Hey, that's like a chick just thinking about," he said
"Look, this is your jam, we got a lot of stuff to say"
That's what he said, so here you go
Forgot who he heard it from, go get it
Listen, man, wait and see what he did
And make sure you get the bottom bunk, man
He also made sure you get the top bunk, man
When he got money, knock 'em down, at least get the mask
Make sure you get the mask right before he put it on
So we don't gettin' freaky fast like we used to be
[Instrumental]
[Instrumental]
[Kurious]
Heh, I thought I'd mention that, we were friends before he passed
I got the picture, just copy it in a minute

[MF Doom]
Right, up at the same time as the Last Boy Scout cookies sold
At the same time as the Super Villain eatin' the brains of a ninja
And trying to figure it all out through word play
By way of rebutting argument
Doom is a fraud, keep watch
I ’em showin' my face
By way of rebutting argument
Doom is a fraud, keep watch
By way of rebutting argument
DOOM is a fraud, keep watch
By way of rebut
====================
[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to

[Verse 1]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?

[Intro]
In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse 1:Earthquake]
I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 17-gauge, double-sided package
[?]
[Intro]
Yo, this is A-1 sauce
[Intro]
And they up and leave me salivating
Searchin' for the next Day Show
[Verse 1]
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat out like a mail order slaughter
My pocketbooks are on
I have become an ageless being
I multiply as many times as I want
I get only graham in a can
Doubt my literacy
It's like a maze man, guessed it
The next day I am summoned
By my evil little helper
[Intro]
Yo, I'mie, I'mie, I'mie
I'mie, I'mie
I'mie, I'mie

====================
[Verse 1]
I keep a flick of you, Father with the silver tongue, Old Yeller new kiddie, whoever end up with the fess
I keep a flick of you, you nah-ism, yeah
Fat rat, the mask is like Jason
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Worf, some say stronger though
Off the top, Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo, pull a fast one
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
Or actressin' and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray J, the old tape
DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shaked
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest goes to camp
For the right earn - kna'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sick
====================

I re-up on bad bumba, ho hop, y'all
(What's that shit?) Hip Hop snitches who's nuts and lefties
Loved the song, didn't like the beat, hoes be like "Man, what the"

[Verse 1]
He donned a mask so he could fit in the trunk
Had a simple purpose, like a bathroom stall
Hiding the body, is the last thing he saw
The mask made it look big enough to fit in the palm of your hand
Said, "Keep it on the dame, it's tight"
One day, he was speeding down Central Avenue
When he got to the section that's between Eckerd Street and Fifth Avenue
There's a gate and a number, and he's tripping
There's a gate and a number and he's tripping
There's a gate and a number and he's tripping
He's tripping on a ho's life
It's over, he's dead
Mashed potatoes, beef, sugar, pain
It's over, he's dead

[Chorus]

I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like [?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were in Cuba, I'd take all ya pesos
So giddyup, this is earthquake on ya stereo
Fuck with me I leave ya soggy like some cereal
I'm gone, checkmate

Make a move like chess then checkmate

[Verse 2]
Some might say I'm lazy, that amped up my game
Others say I'm too used to these streets
Still, the people say the same
I hear you, it's the way the world needs me
The things we need, like water
The plants, like doneness
The trees, blind allegiance
I picture these streets walking lives
And making mom and dad's last
When I went to pick up baby Shalom
She's with me in the right place at the right time
When this mess happens
My plan's, it's supposed to be for you
But you better. You know, when you're done
Mmm, ending a chapter
That's what it's made for
That's what it's made for
That's what it's made for

...So like me, he stay like this
I'm like him, do my thing
Sketch it, put it on the wall
He don't know what he's doing
So tease the pants off, pal
Actual fact, cool as new

[Verse 4]
Some might say I wear a mask for these woods
Others say I go to the shelter

[Outro]
Nah, yo
[Picture]
On the big stage, dancing men and women
Standing around mic, ass kicking, ass flailing
Refresher beat from start to finish
Amazed at all these ladies
Let out the Bon Jovi, make your way 'til the end
Holy up and dig the place
Holy up and dig the place

[Verse 1]
I was thirteen years old, and I was summoned by my Uncle Tom to New York. There, I remained, hoping for the best, for the best, for Uncle Tom to bless me
Gentlemen, my name is Ginzburg

Oh, you're crazy
This will be a problem my man, it won't be a problem
[Chorus]
Oh, you're crazy
This will be a problem my man, it won't be a problem

[Verse 3]
He don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits
Matzos or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos, no matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless
Even uses a code name: Famous Amos
It's cheaper than a short stay at the Day's Inn
And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Skip past the graham animal in Grandma’s
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill

"Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!"
It might seem ill
"Ew! Go wash your hands!"
Kookies
"Get out of here!"

[Chorus]
Oh, you're crazy
This will be a problem my man, it won't be a problem

[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super) ho"
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From niggas with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl
====================
[Verse 1]
Ah fuck with me, I baptize you (Boom)
I bless you with grace, with truth, with blessings, with blessings
You was made for each other, and me and you
Forgiveness, and understanding, and understanding
A lot of stuff happens for a living, but me and you
Not really knowing what'sawful or not understanding what'sawful
You got this other, a whole year supply of ice, and you know what'sawful
I know, that's awesome, and that's what we're doing

[Verse 2]
Who wanna battle?
One for the money, one for the better green

[Hook]
Fight or flight, allies!
GS, M, L, Rugby

[Verse 3]
You don't see that shit on TV, yo' news
(Yeah!) The shit I saw on the big screen
This screen landin blocks, but I'm cheatin'
Scissors, but the lady with the big basket
[Rhymes]
I don't see how you can't be
Agile and thinking that I'm uncontrollable
When I do come across your writing, my friend
Plotting, yours is still speculative
Stress, it's the root of all ills
I'd like to give you some hope
When I hit it, I wrecks, I save em'
Some say it's the seeds of some a-symbol
It's like a ba-dawn plot, a plot between a fiend and a witch
(A-symbol? Nah)

[Outro]
Doom has taken over every continent

[Verse 1]
Hentai porno verse 3, 4
With the rise of pop science and reverse ock handwriting
You need to get her some makeup
The other hand clutched, showing she's got the makeup on
Damn, it's like a cold glass of Olde E
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of ...

As you call 'em,
====================
[Verse 1]
I'd like to give a big big big shout-out to my man Jet Jaguar
He came to work every day for this past week
And made his mark on the industry
He might as well have turned heads in the store
He's one hell of a guy, even the TV
He just came in the store and he ain't seen no gunmen
He came in the store to get some more head start, and he got nothing better to do
Shoot em' dead, give him some structure!
He might as well have turned heads in the chain like ...
[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
He bled my mother and my father, but never really been too ill
Psst! You're pregnant again!
You might even get a little rich!
You could be building Cazals!
You could be building crackers!
You're the first to know!

Goddamn it
Super motherfucking villain goddamn it
About to get these millions, stacks and shit
Yo, his dip tried to tell him
Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around, you bring brighter days
She told him
You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
He told her
I will rock this microphone ... always!

[Verse]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you

====================
[Verse 1]
He drinkin' whiskey, fightin' words he never hear, getting bittering words
Countin' among his friends the men who serve him
Aquaman's sleepin' with a hand full of cash, a load of shit
He might be spittin' in his bed, seein' the stars shining
The best swine are choosier
He might be upstaging"Teddy the leprechaun who hit the patch"
[Chorus]
He won't stop the game, just to get a smile from the villain
The only smile is the one he gave me
When he started smilein' like a nerd
He started out as funny as the guy with the jet
Now he's funny as the Supervillain with a straight face
Can't find him an address, checkmate
He's live chatin' and chatin' his wife
Out in the streets, askin' what the problem
She better be comin' with him
 than me, can't find me

[Verse 2]
He's a notorious felon, pay attention
Wherever he goes, he's lookin' for a reason
To threaten unsuspecting men and boys
He looks for fights in the streets
And up in the mountains and up in the sky
And up in the air
At least he gets loose sometimes
He looks for cover in the night, some guys are seen
Spit his last, he did his thing in the air
Fireworks on the bank, some cops are said to be killed
In the night, Bruce Timm can be heard saying
"Stay tuned for the last time..."

[Chorus]
He won't stop the game, just to get a smile from the villain
The only smile is the one he gave me
When he started smilein' like a nerd
He started out as funny as the hunchback
Now he's funny as the super muthafuckin' hunchback
Can't find him an address, checkmate
He's live chatin' and chatin' his wife
Out in the streets, askin' what the problem
She better be comin' with him
 than me, can't find me

[Bridge]
Can it be I didn't kill him, or did he die?
This is a miracle, it's a script from a

'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?
[Instrumental]
[Intro]
In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse 1:Earthquake]
I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like [?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were in Cuba, I'd take all ya pesos
So giddyup, this is earthquake on ya stereo
Fuck with me I leave ya soggy like some cereal
I'm gone, checkmate

[Hook]
Make a move like chess then checkmate
I
====================
[Verse 1]
I was in a case with hydrochloric acid
And it really, really hurt
Saw the first taste of gelatin
PNS beat fast like "millivore for titty"
I may have missed some rhymes like the way they sound when they rhyme
Or had them rhyme off the top
Have mic clapped while in the middle of a brawl
No, he wasn't just talking dirty talk; he was also quick to laugh
And kept to himself when he spoke a long breath
A lot of the time he just grunted and shook his head
Or had a stressful day and was too lazy to do the thing
(Surrender, sweetheart)

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine helps, mood stabilizers
Naps cost more, work more, relax more
It's fun saying this, but generally speaking I'm kind of broke
Not that far from home, really not
Not broke, who knows? Maybe it's just me
Either way, it's cool how people bring it up

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
It's just a number, number, number, a show of respect
To the dude for man know not a joke
The only thing that come between us is krill and money

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine helps, mood stabilizers
Naps cost more, work more, relax more
It's fun seeing people respect one another selflessly
And generally speaking I'm kind of broke
Not that far from home, really not
Caused me to make a list, number one priority over money

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Not many people know the brook voice like Charles Hooper
Mine go up when I go out, down when I go out
Known amongst foes for that nasty bitterness
Known amongst foes for that nasty wit
That's for sure, fuck it, I'm not ready for the grind yet
Born into it, now I gotta dump you all
For the mic, I ain't settle for nothing
Sending 'em in the street fight, hand job, no shame
Telling 'em get low paid, who knows but I
The world keeps turning
War is just a number, number one hellhole
And two more like
====================
[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to
====================
[Verse 1]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, I got this style I be known for
It's not even about price
For straight up justice
If they pass me, shoot 'em dead
From my pipe, a rhymer, she won't stop the beat
Keep her eye on the high, she said, "The one with the chain"
Damn, she might as well have had a nick in the lock
My choice, it might as well have been GZA
Gimme your head, head and get your wallet
But don't worry, I'm coming with the plan

[Verse 2]
I got this style ever since I was a child
I got this style since high time
I ain't goin' hip hop
Not even close
Hip hop is still just another form of male entertainment
Like "What you doing?
Don't worry about it, man, I'mma help you get a job"
I still carry a Glock rounds on me even after all that hard work

[Verse 3]
Some might say I'm lazy
Some might say I'm a fat rat
Some might even say I'm a weirdo
You need to get me some food, I'm gonna eat that

[Verse 4]
Some might say I'm lazy
Some might say I'm a chick-pop
Some might even say I'm a nympho
You need to get me some food, I'm gonna eat that

[Verse 5]
Some might say I'm lazy
Some might say I'm a chick-pop
Some might even say I'm a nympho
You need to get me some food, I'm gonna eat that

[Verse 6]
Some might say I'm lazy
Some might say I'm a chick-pop
Some might even say I'm a nympho
You need to get me some food, I'm gonna eat that

[Verse 7]
Some might say I'm lazy
Some might say I'm a chick-pop
Some might even say I'm a nympho
You need to get me some food, I'm gonna eat that

[Verse 8]
Some might say I'm lazy
Some might say I'm a chick-pop
Some might even
====================
[Verse 1]
I'd like to say hi
It's {?} fly the odd Merlin
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling
{?} bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God ?, never see God earlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast
Back to you MF Doom, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
{?} co-star or in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower
Lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt {?}
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's in a smash way how he did it
Muthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute
[Intro Skit]
(Narrator): Running desperately low on food, they were forced to turn back
(Interjection): Well I'll be!
(Interjection 2): What's that villain doing?

(Voice 1): Princess, your voice sounds familiar
(Princess): Well it should. You see, DOOM wants me to marry him. But after seeing what he has done to our peaceful world, I despise him. He intends to destroy all of us if I persist in refusing him, even now

[Verse 1: Angelika/StaHHr]
Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'
Intuition, intuition, gettin no like-mindedness
Out of this world, gone and spent the night
In a fit of madness, I banished all thought
Out of this world,
====================
[Verse 1]
I rewind beats like a nerd cat
Got every major from the box-office
Ready and going home
With my mack Big Willie
He got every major from the box-office

[Verse 2]
Yuh! That blew my mind
Even at 55 I'm still going to blast people
With crazy 1-2-3

[Verse 3]
People got fooled by the fake mustache
And now they have the false one
It's a real thing
Even the fake wigs in my book is fake

[Verse 4]
People got tricked by the fake mustache
And now they have the false one
It's a real thing

====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super) ho"
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender
====================
[Verse 1]
I was thirteen and travelling with my uncle
I stopped citywide for a pint
And Gumbo came to town
Like a tsunami for the coast to see
Like a H.P. Lovecraft story told
The back of a blue Skyse
With at least one baby bird species listed
Frenzy was like a cold breath of fresh air
A nuisance that preyed on travelers
While on the alert like Central Park was
While around the neighborhood used to have a fountain
Open seven in the morning and close down the store
Featuring the logo of F.A.C
Ally is always there to help
Don't get psycho'd
She's the sweetest bum in the whole world
You need to stop feeding babies with no toes

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

[Verse 2: Ally]
Shorty in the all black, she said, "Honey, I'm Barry White"
White, you really are sunshine in a suit
In the sky, she said, "Amazing Grace"
You really are sunshine in a suit
In the sky, she said, "Barry White," who's he seein in the sky?

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

[Outro Skit]
(Interjection): Barry, do you remember what you just said?
(Voice): Well, I think I said that about DOOM once
(Bert): Yeah, about DOOM. He's done an amazing job
(Ernie): He knows that I said that. He should be ashamed
(Reed): What do you mean I can't do this
====================
[Verse 1]
I stayed in touch with my soulmate throughout
As you awaken to the beat, I had this strange entity on my neck
Beating heartbreak, when tortured, I'm inclined to leech benevolently
Villain willing, with poor language, to step up and do his thing
Joking, mean-spirited females, I detest

[Verse 2]
Bebeuse, 24, runs the gambit, could've blown up the Parnell
Villain ever mellow, seem bent out of place
Acting all hard, thought he seeing, guessing
Then, he started losing steam, then again, starting losing steam
I cut him off, at first he was mean-spirited
Then, he started losing faith in God, then he started losing faith in me
I chopped him off, at first he was mean-spirited
Then, he started losing faith in God, then he started losing faith in me
I chopped off his head, at first he was wise-spirited
Then, he started losing faith in God, then he started losing faith in me
I baptize you, and if we get out last minute, I'll take him
Catch him when I can, I stay in touch
Just so, we can all step to this problem

[Chorus]
We get where we are and put bricks in it
So we can get where we are and put bricks in it

[Verse 1]
I'd like to thank you all for joining me this evening
It was very much your pleasure, my dear Watson
I'd like to say a few words
Out loud!
Wear a mask like a yorker
Release a hater with a switchbody
Stomping Thor lookout, the super-villain in the world

[Outro]
Hey!
You got anynia/-?
Anything you see that I can do

[Interlude]
Wear a mask like a yorker
Release a hater with a switchbody
Stomping Thor lookout, the super-villain in the world
[Verse 1]
Batman and Robin, out with the gold head
Time to gather... gather your things
Time to reflect
What's the hero thinking?
What's the villain thinking?
What's the enemy thinking?
Shadows continually closing
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

[Hook]
That's a double dumb, he read the dictionary
"Super" the word, he check it, "Is there a fly in this circle?
Yes, he is, the super" the invisible hand
Who got the most respect? The average hater

[Verse 2]
Who told you that? Bust a recessed oil pan
Smack the naysayers, "Fake news, lies"

[Verse 3]
Other world, where's that? Heaven forbid

[Hook]
In the sky, some mirage
The earth is flat, the only things that fill me are pills
The more I use the syringe, the bigger I fill

[Hook]
With the hidden gunmen, get the president's ear

[Verse 4]
Don't follow where he's going, but he's following where orders
 Not encouraging behavior, don't believe him

[Hook]
He should be ashamed of himself
 Command in the earth, he's still a fish

[Verse 5]
Nothing comes after that, then you know what I'm saying
Eat all of you alive, could've eaten all of you
Dead or dying, I'm watching my neck. . . .
[Verse 6]
Don't follow where he's going, but he's following where orders
Not encouraging behavior, don't believe him

[Verse 7]
Eat all of you alive, could've eaten all of you
Dead or dying, I'm watching my neck. . . .
[Verse 8]
DOOM go to the bedroom and start to sing
====================
[Verse 1]
I wrote this one in B.C.
Plus a copy of Evolve
It's called Metal Face Rewind

[Verse 2]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Saw it in a sweatshop, this tooth fairy'll blow your mind
Took the name of a river, now what's the catch?
What's the catch, he can't be, it's Congo
Gone but a fly, back to the lab, study computer
Q. What kind of bugs do this?
A. Heady, vivid, sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating
Syntax hay, sometimes I'm hallucinating
Numb, sometimes I'm hallucinating
Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm doing, it's like being in a maze
Each angle feels like it's being pulled at the wrist
When I do get a chance to lay down my life, it's to deliver a loud thud
Metal Face Rewind is what he says what she says
Be brief, that's more sauce for the dish
Like Seung-Hui Do, Kim Yo-Sang
Who got more rhymes than lines when he put them together
(Heh, that's a little bit of everything, good)
Heh, that's a little bit of everything, good)

[Outro]
Check it out, it's Check it out, it's
Yo, Sup!
[Intro]
Check it out, it's
Yo, Sup!

[Verse]
It's a horror story, yes, it is
When I was little, horror was just another word for people not intelligent
To people that's too cold, that's too hot, that's too dirty
To people that's too friendly, that's too funny that's too twisted
That's what they call me, what they call me
People that's too big, that's too small
That's what they call me, what they call me
People that's too small, that's too large

[Verse 3]
It's funny how fools look in the eyes of God, when they see the kind of people that I've got
This one with the bald spot, it might as well be
Diagon Alley, punk rock
The other one with the same face, it might as well be
Swamps and graham
====================
[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to
====================
[Verse 1]
I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'll come scoop her around 8, she said ("Super!")
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like ("Super!”)
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring ("Super!")
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper
Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off she said niggas ain't about shit
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smacking rookies, he is the ("Super!")
Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low
Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent
Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off "All in the Same Gang"
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the ("Super!")
See most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ("Super!")
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be ("Super!")
Do for her, keep her in a new fur

====================
[Verse 1]
I keep a flick of you, getting sneaked by the Grimm
And even after that, you never know
You could have me locked up right here in L.A.

Who's the fuck you see? You be doing it again
You been doing it for long enough, you know it's time
Keep it on your own like, you know, you know, mellow
Produced the music, no feud found
Time to mellow it up, mellow it down
Blare it in your krills, boil it, steeple it
Call it what you will rhymes, Bruce Leroy style
Instruct it like, ya won't find 'em in a secluded spot
Or in the habit of saying it, sing it
Hip hop's hippie slang
For now in jail, out in the country
You know the one with the bubble eyes
Tied to the frying pan, breathing swamp air
And he'd like to say hi
Like a brother, a friend
A brother, a friend
A brother, a friend
A brother, a friend
A brother, a friend

Yo, yo
Doom has taken over every major city Doom has taken every major section of it
It's like a game of chicken, with every city he comes out on top
He really has taken over every major city since King Geedorah was on
When he got money, he really gave every human being a pat on the back
Like a ring, it shows the money in the ring
Not sure what it is, but
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

[Verse 2]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit
====================
[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o", next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to
====================
[Verse 1]
Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who asked me what we don't got that you got son
For one flow that's elementary, my dear Watson
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chop these drums off
Truly yours, G Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black
I'm not the cool sleet stack
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be bitin styles I'm like pork to
Oooh...what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the style's from the cess
Shit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand
Throwin emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan
It ain't no use in tryin, man
Son, stop cryin
Frontin' like you death-defyin'
You need to stop lyin'
Speak your piece only once you've been told
And heard once you've been told
Now you have no other choice but to listen

[Verse 2: DOOM]
I read in the paper the facts
That evil take the life of a police officer
And leave it be seen: Alhamdulillah
The ability to turn a deaf ear into a good ten sound smart
Spearheadedness, and you're all dead if you don't do your duty
And vote for president, my lady.
[Intro]
Flash forward a thousand years, and we have the current state of the world
It's either pretty or dire, depending on how you spell it
We are in an age of super heroes, where anybody can get a hero
And still get in great shape
It's horrible, it's inhuman, it's degrading
It's not fun, it's degrading, man
To be fair, it's horrible, it's degrading
But uh...we all suffer, and we all work hard to get here

[Chorus]

====================
[Verse 1]
I read in the newspaper that her biological father was dead
I turned it off for lack of a better light
And used to gather dust near the statue of St. Giles
Here I was a bit grainy
Back in the days when we used to gather around a roly-poly
I know, it's crazy how it sounds like
To have a villain with a history of violence
And lost all of his wealth, perhaps it's a cold case
Or perhaps it's the villainous touch
On the wrist and the drawls and dings
From vaster guns to super-villain cells
Tops to the stars, to the slow spin
Blazing swords the deadliest globes
But the wisest of all time, bless him

[Verse 2]
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with a frown like a mosquito
Walked for days on end, ate at least one earring
And a spastic, for a dandy to try to board a train
The wanker gon' rule the world, faster than a speeding knife
And wear a mask so he don't get caught
When he got money he used to laugh it's like a old coin-operated
Goatspeak! And then he started losing new pounds
Then suddenly all the cats in the house!
Yeah, that's right! There it is, gonna be!!

[Verse 3]
Who told, real steel go right after the ampersand
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, tick, clock how long till the tick come through?
Then it hit her like a really bad earthquake
Crippled her, hit her with a brick (the brick?)
She's a coward, run if you want to run
Got a rock, rock, rock, run if you want to go
You're too kind, I'll be a good kind of guy

[Verse 4]
Some brothers in the rock band swim, some do for leashes
We used to have the niggas to the party, light the clothing
We was bitches like Boces
Now we get bitches from all over
Tries to take off the panties, can't stand the ladies
But when the heat dies down fast, you can feel the heat
Sugar-mommy be blingin' in

I had this style ever since I was a kid
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, I got this
Different sound with different lyrics
Different styles with different artist(s)
Faster, I got cash
Same style with different lyrics
Different styles with different artist(s)
Faster, I got more cash

Hemp, I got split ends

[Verse 2]
He don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thumb, Saltine Chloride
In the land of lyrical pause, the stuntedite
Quite the lyrical lazy
Not a bad nigga, the hard workin' man
At times, the handmic would wheel
Others, more often than not, would wheel
The ones that did more than just flipped the wazoo
The one that did more damage than good
Splashed it, it was the dumbest shtick I've heard
From a niggas out here playing taqwa
Told the lie, the one that's steady, ain't have to worry
Told the truth, it's the other one

[Verse 3]
What up?
To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep your shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM, tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby
He's in the lab on

====================
[Verse 1]
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown

[Hook: MF DOOM]
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

[Bridge: MF DOOM]
Doomsday
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang. metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and

[Verse 1]
He looked like a Hendrix
Accordion
Carried lots of presents
Wonder no doubt
He couldn't afford to cop that
Taught a hater a thing or two
 Ain'thin heiress never told him

[Verse 2]
He sounded like a whizz running with the ladies
Invisible Woman
The trace amounts to a thumb - gosh, tell a hater
Told her be back, maybe she didn't feel him
Then he started flirting with the dirtiest of women
Ally was a little older
The things he said made her feel dirty
Did him, and now he's a star
If you ever see him, drop a line to my editor

Look, there! I have removed the above image from YouTube

I listen, study, study
As the mics wear off, more and more of what I learned
Listen to what I have to say
Mics need to be kept really just that, really, really, really
So out of whack, really wrong
So feel free to use my techniques

Give thanks, then get back on your feet
The last thing I saw was a bareth braid
My father had a well made, he worked fast
He had a thin line between us, could afford to
The only two that spoke was loud and clear
Many have the same name as the dentist that provided the braces
Butter and lead time, tell all
Have different day schedules than the Sunday
And Monday
I'm home with my wife and four little boys
It's quiet in there, there's not much to eat
The only thing that come between us is eggs and cheese
And drinkin', it's like a game of catch

[Verse 3]
If you aren't used to seeing me, I'm still your bum
If I'm wrong, what the hell?
You may be saying these things just to get attention
It's just a show, don't know what I'm saying
But I'm attention seeking, can't sleep at night
Wanting to be number one, number-one hit OK Man
To Billy Madison, number-one hit man
Ever since I was little
Not a fan of graham wood, no man
I think I'm a little bit strange, there's no need to frighten you
Just a little something, let me know if I'm right

I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, I got this
More style, way more shit, than the next dude
(Hey! What style of chicks are you?)
More chicks, cause we like to show off our art
(Yeah we do)

[Verse 2]
I got this style from working in the insulation business
I got this other style I guess, asinine
Saying the least star a phenomenon
That's for sure ho know the answer

[Verse 3]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this style from working in the bank
[Inventor, not the name]
Yes, that's the right way to put it, how he doing?

[Verse 4]
I got this style since high school
(Science!)
I got this every year since college
People!
More people!
(People!)

[Verse 5]
What's the name?
It might be foul, bi-lingual
Different men lead different lives
doomsaying or dutchie
I'm out here, trying to find out what's going on
Mentally disturbed, trying to act proper
Stress, confusion, disturbed dreams
Feeling better, may be sending messages
Worrying about what's really going on
Pleasure Island, getting along great
Not so much right, being a father is stressful
But being a father to your child is also stressful
Being a father to your child is also stressful
Being a brother is also stressful
Taking care of your child, even if it's for paternity
That's just a little bit of that

====================
[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to

[Verse 2]
To hoes like Henry Kissinger, P.J. Sapong
We can stop the bleeding in Mexico, then we can try to stop the flow
In Hell, if you ain't poppin', fill the earth with saliva
Then quit stowing your car in Mexico
And checkin', if you dead, who's to say niggas don't

[Verse 3]
To love is to hate
To love is to poor nigga who's walkin' thin-skinned
Just don't like what I doin' around here
Don't know where I live, don't know what the fuck I'm up to
From all the wars and robberies I've ever done
It's like a
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

[Verse 2]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
Tat-tat, that's the end of that
After hit
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper

After hit the bar where baby girl bartender
====================
[Verse 1]
He donned a mask so he could hide face
Then went to the police
Got hold of a absolute, they charged
Then plead guilty

[Verse 2]
Lo, the never bossy, never see the boss coming
Soon as he outgrew the mask, it started to feel like pauper hair
And he was getting money
Watch him get the mask from a name-buckin' emcee
Who he want it to be, but what he want it to be
A villain with a secret agenda, come on
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
A play on the word villain
A villain with a bad habit of saying the word when he need niggards' information
Getting money, fame and buildings through lies
Taking heat from up in the quad, ain't that music
[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Verse 1 : Big Punisher]
Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Segall
Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (that's it?) That's it

[Verse 2 : Cuban Link]
Punisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, havin caviar
Crackin Cristal at the bar, smokin cigars, livin large
We rob and steal, run with it, doin jobs for bills

====================
[Verse 1]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?
[Instrumental]
[Intro]
In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse 1:Earthquake]
I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like [?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were in Cuba, I'd take all ya pesos
So giddyup, this is earthquake on ya stereo
Fuck with me I leave ya soggy like some cereal
I'm gone, checkmate

[Hook]
Make a move like chess then checkmate
I
====================
[Verse 1]
I hold the mic, like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, "Darling you was stupid though"
You know the Super Villain, (He is a super hoe)

[Verse 2]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees their styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's The Super Metal Face Villain, He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
And made his mark on the world, burning stacks like "Burn this"
He did it like the sun, dimpling, soy sauce
Mashed potatoes in a pot, warm like a bulb
In she said heat, who ever ishotics know
He came through raw like the sun, snot cracking as it burn
Like the elements on a leash like a chilli
Fire extinguish all lights fountains
He came through beautiful as winter, lilac in the air
Heroes first, follow the leader
Then the ladies, name-drops
Gradually, we see her in the papers
Major, Federal, and all the other females

[Outro]
Hey!
That's a long time coming to call this
(I call her) Hey! That's a long time coming to call this
(I call her) Hey!
You listening to THE WORDER'S EPIC COLLECTION
Listen here

[Verse 1]
It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold,
====================
[Verse 1]
He donned a mask so his man don't look big
He hit the high note so don't be shocked if his man get little money
He probably wouldn't get a single kned ass sweep
Cock him, bet him not to flatter his crush
Thought he was a rapper, but he's a dummy
Used to keep a red and blue sweatshirt emblazoned
With the smashbuck, the super-duper, and he drooled
On camera, always ready to spill some dough
I'm so broke, I left him for dead in no uncertain hands
He had the look of a superhero, from the roof
He in, the one with the platinum, from the low
Who knew? It's like a flash, pop, pop
Uh, jakes, jakes off the pills
Who got the best shit on the whole floor?
Cheers!
[Intro]
(Hot shit) (aww shit)

[Verse 1: Count Bass D]
I strive to be humble, lest I stumble
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust
Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up
Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders
(Hot shit)

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
What, these old things? About to throw 'em away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ
Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay
MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?
Working on a way that we can roll away tinted
Some say the price of holding heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die
They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry
You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat
I
