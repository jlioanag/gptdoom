Who got the most whips gats and cash?
If you ask the villain, he say who gives a rats ass
Can't take it wit'choo you when you breathe ya last
In the meanin in between pass that grass
Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank
He often'd time drank by the river bank
An kept a silver shank, for a calm cat
Always stayed strapped for hand to arm combat
For DOOM the bell tolls
Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes
It's filled up to the brim wit sold souls
Crackheads dope fiends an 40's of ol' gold
Hold up, the boldest who ever sold it
Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded
Like holly hobby, gosh golly gee
The back of hector hoskerish's trolly red wash me
Dag nabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet
Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit
They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett
A fiend for the mic an can't kick it like a sick habit
Give him a hero's holla
Along wit more free dough than Creflo Dollar
Holy toledo how he make base on the today show
They say he wear a mask in case his face show
It's better than a stocking bird brain
Find him on the corner rockin mockingbird lane
He's a odd man grandma
And she's a bad mamma-jamma either squeeze the damn hammer
Or stop complainin, on the top he's remainin
A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin
The people say he's the nicest
He only wants to be left alone to his own devices
If the price is right he might sing a new smash
Then laugh an twist his Rollie Fingers moustache
Tear ya crew a new.. gash
An prepare a new batch, of his own special herb goulash
Villain, the dork who talk funny
An he'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk money
Like Semy say, do more boomers, they cure tumors
And beware of the Doomsta
The lust is show the story, grodier than Mr. Crowley
For those embarrassed to know holier than Darrell Morley  habits
Paris to the Gobi bring him up to speed slowly
On the low key, Kindles is phony D
Taste stale, see the world in shades of gray-scale
Right there in black and white, protected by chain-mail
Today’s the day, made your way see ya sister'n'um
Took my little mens with her, told em loved em.. kisseded them
These over-sensitive youngins' is on some new stuff
Can't sit still and focus the time it takes to do enough
From the mean streets of the ‘Can I get a dollar dude?’
Above measure the singular pleasure of solitude
It’s your poison, if you so choose, absorb it
Veins to the brain, shoot off into orbit
How you know octagon? Or much less Tetragrammaton
To get the good stuff you gotta get out to the Amazon
With any luck you might just score locally
Keep it on the hush when you speakin' on it vocally
Then you gotta be on the in, a known member
I think I still owe 'em lil something since November, whatever
Who need credit when cash speak? Forget it
Sweatin' sittin on this package since last week
We all got weaknesses, even the functionin' dead
Some’ll end up fudgin' numbers, buggin' and lunchin' instead
It’s Netflix to the head, second best trick to get the chicks in the bed
Listerine green jars, sick cleans, jallad be a enma
Thick queens, mamma mia robs jalapeno peppers
Click mean large, brick seen mirage is ours
Quick mean cause, strict deen Allah
Make your quota, check your clock shock taqwa
Concoct the potion, blue liner lotion, call it aqua
Tock you on watch, sure ahk, salaat two rak'at
Four to roll in extorter mode, loose spot too hot
Here you go ma, for you boo, that's coco mango
She let her hang go, her man said "yo no tango"
Bangles jangle, no gangs is tranquil
Black grill, real shank steel, bankroll ankle
F to the N and R, two thiefs are bummin a car
But never had no beef so Alhamdulillah
Inshallah any duties, top grillers, no Mercedes sign
Bubble nuggets with the ruby, Cop Killer 89
On a line on the third like Lupin
Word is a bond that's honored don, shukraan... afwan
Ram the adhan
Livin sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad alayhi as-salaam
Stuck in a maze, a labyrinth of hate. Shattered doors in
A mask of haze. Struggling madly in a cage. Desperately
Searching for a way out of the maze. Running blindly not
Feeling the floor, nothing to stand on we fall. Lost in
The halls, I'm looking for the doors. Confusion! My
Senses are dying. My soul is crying. Let me out, let me
Out! I'm screaming! Running blindly through the visions
Barefoot and defenseless. Running blindly through the
Dark, infested woods. Time and time again. Disillusion
I'm deeper in the maze. Further from the light. I scream
Out of the confusion. I'm being consumed by confusion. My

World has been shattered. Crippled. All we have left is
Fragments of doors. Though we once had but never had
We've all been fooled. Confusion. My senses are dying my
Soul is crying. Let me out. Let me out. I'm screaming
I'm living in a demented labyrinth. tortured. Lost
Crippled. I'm a part of this confusion. Shattered
Confusion. Shattered vision. All that I have left is
Illusion. I'm screaming at the confusion. I'm being
Consumed by confusion. In an abstract, in a world of
Confusion!
Forced live lives
We don't want to lead
Abiding by rules
Living on our knees
In lak'ech planetary kin
Red overtone dragon make your barathary spin
In the flesh with a band of merry men
Innocent civilians hari kari over yen
Is it the end or for pretend?
I can neither condemn, nor defend
Cats, that's more pussy than a sanitary napkin bin
Villain ran a scam on his imaginary rapping friend
Again, shame on us
We in the same game, put the blame on Gus
Study til your brain vomit
Just don't be out getting money when it rain comets
Armpits of funk, a bomb in the hunk a junk trunk
Metal palm on your ma's badunkadunk
In a park in a rave under three days of darkness
Tell a hater behave and spark this
With the fresh banana berry blend
Counting mad tens 'til when January begin
The other hand clutched to a pen, 24/7 much to his chagrin
Used to drink gin, now he only drink oxygen water
Mixed with shark fins that cleanse the toxins sorta
And if they ever come get me
We were sippin rum on a number one jitney
I can neither confirm nor deny
On account of the sherm all high
Villain make 'em squirm 'til her perm all dry
Sperm to her eye, to a worm to a fly
It's germs, and mad babies to kiss
Won't stop rockin except to maybe take a piss
Or soak his feet in a mineral oil vat
Holding a Rodin coil in his tin foil hat
Step aside, give him some room playa
Til the end of days he'll be the ill doomsayer (slayer)
Well anyway
You may be saying about now
"How in the world is that old fella eat all of that crazy stuff
And not get sick to his stomach?"
Haha, well, don't worry about that
You see, whenever I make a pig of myself on the filet
Or the pudding or something
I mix up some herbs and
I come up with a dandy glass of this
Bicarbonate of fig leaf
That'll set me free, I'll tell you
Ugh

Edible wrappers may be in grocery stores as soon as months from now
You've heard of good to the last drop
Well your food could soon be good to the last bite

Wow! That was loud!
Got to ya, huh?

Here's an interesting note: artificial colors
Yellows or Reds
Let's focus on the red
In addition to FD&C Red Number 40, the FDA has approved certain food coloring additives, some are actually POISON!
If you aren't sure of the additives or colorings in the products you've purchased, LEAVE IT ALONE!
POISON!
BAD NEWS!
THAT'S RIGHT!

Thank you
Well, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here
Now then, I have to go take my dessert here
I have to go
I'm conducting a cooking class today
Good health to you all!
Uh, over this way
Look out!

Alright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal?

One look at his feature-less face
One look was enough to ensure his safety
As years passed, he became even more bitter and angry
Burning with vengeance against the world
Finally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking
Then, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor, and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic, he returned to his homeland
And there he has remained
Scheming, dreaming, planning
Plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world
(I can't believe it!)
(Alright, don't make a big deal about it)
I warn you Doom, you've gone too far
(Yeah!)
That'll do it Doom, get your machine
Whenever I'm expecting a lot of company
Haven't had a lot of company in a long time
But if I were expecting some
I'd whip up a really (ugh) substantial meal
You see how strong I am? (heh)
It's from eating all this stuff

Good healthy meal like the...fillet

Now that's what they call...soul food
Now you got black-eyed peas
Carrot greens
Collard greens
Cornbread
Watermelon
And for dessert
Pork butts

Eat heartily gentlemen

I got a really stressful day and I really really needed some food
Something healthy like beets

Showed you how good it is
Well you may say "I don't think I'd care for that"
So you could also fix yourself a...
Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask em after ten miles of his goulashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know. It show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible
Time is money spend way save invest the fess
From ten case of cave with chicken chest S
Yes ya'll the dub will get your trickles
The best ballers pitch in to rub and get a nickels
But tut tut, he about to change the price again
It go up each time, he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama
Got em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold a inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smokin' with the triggers broke
I thought I told em "firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go an rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still there's no thrill
Villa bill ya 10K bills in his pilla
Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with...
Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet 'cha by the nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Warf, some say stronger though
Off the top J strong bow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
A actress and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray Jay the old tape
DOOM - well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PHD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the celin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Earnest goes to camp
For the right earn - na'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
One mans waste is another mans soap
Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bug rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorous'h
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be singin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparkling jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split the wig, slit
Villain is willy nilly!
(Live in stereo)
Want you to call me at that address, if I'm still there, then I'll make sure you get the crack
Doom has taken over every continent! Meanwhile, back in space, Doom continues to search for colleagues
And your name?
Khan is my name. Khan, nothing else. Khan
As the funky beat continues, a rock steady
We have got to try to find Doom!
Good luck!
Time to get the feta!
Gumbo!

You gotta watch your gums on this
But it's, it's very good, it's very healthy

(Not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal)
You would only want to use the wraps when there's no food associated with the use of the wraps
So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats
Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day
(It's hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
Create a new demand for produce
Stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
And eat more chitlins)
*beatboxing intensefies*
He walk around town with a frown like Homey the Clown
Shelltoe Lee crown, well blow me down
Blow! hell no, he sound funny
Outta bounds tryin'ta cop a pound with brown money
Keep the change, peep game, the Range
Inches on the fringes of a deep steepa' strange
When he met a dread at the swine roast
Find him in the zone up ahead near the sign post
Follow the beat, you won't stumble
Shut your mouth, swallow your feet, or try'an rumble
In discreet they lie and mumble
Catch 'em in the street they as humble as Bryant Gumble cryin' fumble
Don't let him get the call
Keep a stack a diss rhymes, one-size-fits-all
Tries ta' avoid the pitfall
Or else get hit in the eye with a old dry spitball
You must be crazy out ya mind
Even on the days he feel lazy he shout rhymes
No chains, no bridge, does get outshined
When he come blaze it people say it's about time
The old God with the old gold gold card
When he's on the road it's no-holds-barred
No lard, in the record game on some bull guard
So many nekked dames he might blow his whole wad
He learn somethin' new everyday
Go ahead and burn, they ain't nothin' to do anyway
'cept sell tracks out the Cheverolet like lemonade
And go gold in the hood so he can get ghetto paid
Now that's usin' the ol' cranium
Like the jewelry cat who sold him fake plat uranium
Guaranteed to turn necks green like the Hulk
Have it manufactured by machine in bulk
They rock 'n roll like: 'Stop, Drop . . .'
And if they got soul, then welcome to the sock hop
Hip-be-bop at ya block mom 'n pop shop
Time it when when it comes to rhymin' is chop-shop
Keep it lit till the last stroke'a the pen
And ya don't quit like ya quit smokin' again
They said he keep his lyrics poked in a tin
And his secret recipe, soak it in some gin
Brings the heat like a radiator
Stays on beat with the mask like a gladiator
Sword is the mic cord
And he came to turn it out like a dike broad out the psych ward
I recollect when he first took the sector
He use the connect-the-dot styles as a mic checka
Told him give the deposit, book the lecture
The crooked look wrecka, HOOKS IS EXTRA!!!
Keep your mind on your mask, kid
Holler for my classics, it's drastic
Villain the hydrochloric acid, splashed it
Pull the Nine, reached then he blasted, Pow!
Pin stripes on a basket
New York style wild
Cheddar grab easy
It's only entertainment though, when thought out completely
Sad demeanor, could get him the drop and bag cleaner
Master schemer
Expert in that arena
Puffin' Pasadena
You read the grass was greener
Black beamer
I8 she gyrate
Rubbing shoulders with pigs don't fly straight
Just ate, causing indigestion
Will soon regurgitate, into profits, no question
Nosy agent sniffing around, pay attention
You could take that to the bank
"Thanks", don't mention
Pleasure's all mine, ain't mad at y'all
Clear advantage like playing paddle ball on adderall
Be brief, that is all
Aight, one more rhyme
Self-snitching rappers who's lines is pure pork rinds
It's yours, it's his, and mine
Your homework space cubical, smirk face crucible
Super luminal, (???), loose pull
Need to re-roll that, he sold stat old hat
And Dungarees, new shoes for baby
Food, clothing and shelter, no if ands or maybes
Maintain the gravy train, laid claims of slavery
Bad investment banking, the best went blanking
Shitting, stanking
Witnessing the slang king, hypnotist ranking
And don't quit
Keep your mind on your mask, kid
Holler for my classics, it's drastic
DOOM, hydrochloric acid, splashed it
Pull the Nine, reached then blasted, Pow!
To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosevic
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speakeasy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic be like "Tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the vet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette's
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
But uh... word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop Benny Hill, Sip Henny straight
Get every penny, wait, then he chill, at any rate
My metal face hoes with tongue or 'least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
Then the super-villain struck again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a known drop from the, liver conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I
Drop degrees like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed
So way back spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin"
Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain
This might be a good time to replenish your napkin supply. Let us take a short break. Now relax.
Relax
What do you want?
(speaking Klingon)
I don't speak Klingon
(speaking Klingon)
No. Where is the bathroom?
Do you know anyone here?
No, I don't know anyone here.
Are you transporting Tribbles?
No, I'm not transporting Tribbles.
I'm a Terreth! Are you a Klingon?
Yes. What do you want?
(villian!)
(speaking Klingon)
(Well, thanks!)
Excuse me
(spitting noise)
What is your number, Terreth?
My eyes sting. Now I can smell something. Help! Get help quickly!
(crying)
To Terrens, this might seem a tackless way to begin a conversation, but among Klingons, it's considered quite civil.
Stop relaxing!
(speaking Klingon)
Transcibing soon
(x3)
I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hell
Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Frangrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin everybody hit it
I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinnner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds
Little young thing, she likes to do the tounge thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin wit that white girl
She fuckin wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish
And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

No friendly warfare, this ain't wrestlin'
There's nothin' staged over here, you're trippin' Mescaline
Drinkin', coulda got smacked for what he thinkin'
Coulda said the word, then whack! Abe Lincoln
And still spend stacks off crack, stay crinklin'
This game's built to get got while blinkin'
Rappers do big up jail like a recruiter
Let 'em tend ta hit a boy, said he was a shooter
Told him "Man up, or keep it pushin' like a scooter"
Then said nuttin' and didn't pass the Buddha
Lo and behold, police shows up
Spit his shitty sixteen and got his self froze up, up
His story had a moral, it's buried in the soil
Vil put it in her back like the epidural
Kids: eat, sleep, stay away from creeps
Spit it from the heart, this game's for keeps
So peep
Yeah, saga of a true B-Boy
Beware any likenesses or imagery is a decoy
Sho nuff, yo fluff, force like Bruce Leroy
Bring trouble up and get double cut— keloid
Bubble up, run 'em up, destroy
And anything else you see— void
Rightful ownership
Got a bone to pick with the phoniest colonialist
Who own a ship
The loneliest known to rip
Known to sip pine and ripple
Find yourself in a bind and pickle
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, bite the nipple
In this land of black and brown, ain't no backin' down
As foul as that sound, it's hard to find a cap and gown
But it's always like a MAC around
B-r-r-r-r-at!! Man down
Metal is empowered, devil is a coward
It all smells of high hell like no one ever showered
Scrub behind ya ears, shed the final tears
Remember what the world was like in the final years
Just a speck of dirt in the universe, snap fingers
Just like that— assume the worst
Back in business, guzzle beers, track and fitness
Laps get faster, could've missed Christmas
What is this?

Want not need
Consumer greed

Don't know where it came from
And don't really care
As long as there's more
As long as it's there
Everyone has one
Why haven't I?
Saw it on TV
Just gotta buy!

Want not need
Consumer greed
